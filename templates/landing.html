        <p>
            Given the time I spent preparing talks&mdash;which is time well-invested if you ask me&mdash;I have always been frustrated by the little visibility they get. This page is my attempt to correct that. It showcases (almost) all the presentations and talks I have given over the years since 2008, in reverse chronological order.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides learning about my research, browsing this list also shows how my presentation style has evolved over the years. (Hopefully for the better, but I'll let you be the judge of that.)
        </p>
        <p>
            For each talk, you'll find a description of its context along with links to both an online (and relatively mobile-friendly, at least in landscape mode) slideshow and the PDF. Links to recordings are also included, whenever available. The online slideshow is made using <code>reveal.js</code>. Use arrow keys to navigate, <code>Space</code> for next slide, <code>F</code> for fullscreen, <code>O</code> or <code>Esc</code> for overview, and <code>?</code> for the complete list of keyboard shortcuts. In case you wonder, I use <code>Keynote</code> for designing my slides and rely on a grid-based design.

            A couple of highlights:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
            <li>A <a href="fmano-keynote/index.html">keynote talk</a> where I survey our recent works on network verification</li>
            <li>My <a href="tenure_talk/index.html">tenure talk</a> reviewing key works since joining ETH in 2015</li>
            <li>The presentation I gave during my <a href="erc_synet/index.html">ERC Starting Grant interview</a></li>
            <li>My <a href="phd_thesis/index.html">PhD defense</a> from way back in 2012</li>
            <li>My <a href="inm/index.html">first ever talk at a conference</a> (not the greatest, but we all start somewhere)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Disclaimer: As many, I sometimes give the same talk at multiple places. To avoid useless redundancies, I only show one copy of each. (If you are interested in a more exhaustive list, feel free to check out my curriculum vitae.) For questions or complains, feel free to reach me at <code>lvanbever@ethz.ch</code>.
