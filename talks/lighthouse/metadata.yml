    description: "Every year our [research group](https://nsg.ethz.ch) goes on a retreat for a couple of days. Among many things, we use this time to reflect on new project ideas. The overarching theme of our retreat in 2022 was sustainability. I gave this talk at the beginning of the retreat to discuss about the idea of a solar-powered Internet backbone. FYI, we haven't pushed (yet) on the idea, but the time might come."
