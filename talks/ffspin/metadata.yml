    description: "A keynote talk I gave at the [Workshop on Formal Foundations and Security of Programmable network INfrastructures](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2022/workshop-ffspin.html) (FFSPIN), which was co-located with SIGCOMM. In there I reflect on how network programmability can: help us protect network infrastructures (the good); be the target of attacks (the bad); or, worse, enable new ones (the ugly)."
